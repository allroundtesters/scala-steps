Scala OO:
- every thing is object
- class and trait
- mixin-based composition

class:
```scala
Classes in Scala are blueprints for creating objects. 
They can contain methods, values, variables, types, objects, traits, and classes which are collectively called members.
```
trait:
```scala
Traits are used to share interfaces and fields between classes. They are similar to Java 8â€™s interfaces. 
Classes and objects can extend traits but traits cannot be instantiated and therefore have no parameters.
```

Scala Functional:
- every function is a value
- higher-order functions
```
Scala allows the definition of higher-order functions. These are functions that take other functions as parameters, or whose result is a function
```
- currying

```scala
Methods may define multiple parameter lists. When a method is called with a fewer number of parameter lists, then this will yield a function taking the missing parameter lists as its arguments.
```
- pattern matching
- case classes
- singleton objects
- right-ignoring sequence patterns
- extractor objects
- comprehensions

Scala type system:
- generic classes
- variance annotations
- upper and lower type bounds
- inner class and abstract types
- compound types
- explicitly typed self reference
- implicit parameters and conversions
- polymorphic methods
- local type
